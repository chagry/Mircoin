# Mircoin.com - Brain & Paper bitcoin wallet.

The easyest way of accessing bitcoin, without installation, download or storing your data. You just need to remember your passphrase.

### The characteristics of the wallet are:

* **Brain wallet.** A wallet that exists nowhere except in your brain.
* **Safe wallet.** We do not keep any trace of your private data, the wallet is regenerated from the passphrase every time.
* **Anonymous wallet.** No registration or account validation, simply enter your passphrase to access to your wallet.
* **Security wallet.** You have a web interface, but your data is handled locally with JavaScript. Your private key never passes through the network.

You keep the full control on your money. Nobody can access or make payments with your bitcoin address.

To test the application, you can just try the passphrase "a".
